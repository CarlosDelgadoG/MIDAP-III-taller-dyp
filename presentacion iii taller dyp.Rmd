## About PHQ-9


## PHQ-9 Items (1-3)

Over the last 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered
by any of the following problems? 

```{r}
grafo_phq(c("s11_01_rec","s11_02_rec","s11_03_rec"),c("Little interest in things","Feeling down","Trouble with sleep"))
```

## PHQ-9 Items (4-6)

Over the last 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered
by any of the following problems? 

```{r}
grafo_phq(c("s11_04_rec","s11_05_rec","s11_06_rec"),c("Tired or little energy","Poor appetite or overeating","Feeling bad about yourself"))
```

## PHQ-9 Items (7-9)

Over the last 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered
by any of the following problems? 

```{r}
grafo_phq(c("s11_07_rec","s11_08_rec","s11_09_rec"),c("Trouble concentrating","Moving slowly or restless","Thoughts of hurting yourself"))
```


## Aggregated PHQ-9 score {.smaller}

For each of the 9 items recode "Not at all" as 0, "Several days" as 1, "More than half the days" as 2, and "Nearly everyday" as 3. Then sum all items. The result is a score that ranges from 0 to 27.

       x="PHQ-9 Score",
